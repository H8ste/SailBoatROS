# SailBoatROS
Arduino code for [Plymouth's Autonomous Sailboat](http://165.227.238.42/). This contains the libraries, controllers and architecture of our arduino low-level controller for our sailboats. This arduino acquires all the data from the different sensors and send them to the main PC. It has also security features in case the PC shuts down.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE : https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
- Arduino Mega 2560 : (tested and working)
- Arduino Uno : 

### Installing

First copy the folder librarie and put it in Documents/Arduino/.

You should be able to launch the .ino, compile and upload to the arduino.
